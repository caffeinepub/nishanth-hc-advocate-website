  "summary": "All three requirements are implemented in the diff. REQ-38 is addressed in Cases.tsx with the encoded URL using %28/%29. REQ-39 is addressed in both Home.tsx and Cases.tsx with onClick handlers on service cards that navigate to /appointment and call window.scrollTo(0,0). REQ-40 is addressed via a ScrollToTop component in App.tsx and handleNavClick in Navbar.tsx. The implementation appears complete and consistent with the acceptance criteria.",

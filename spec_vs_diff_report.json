  "summary": "The diff implements a React + TypeScript SPA using TanStack Router (not React Router as specified), with all five pages, shared Layout/Navbar/Footer/WhatsAppFloat components, SEO, language switcher, animations, and forms. The implementation is largely complete but uses TanStack Router instead of the required React Router, the visual theme uses dark backgrounds instead of the specified white/off-white (#ffffff, #f8f8f5), and the footer copyright year is dynamic rather than hardcoded to 2026.",
